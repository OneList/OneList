## Introduction 

Have you ever had trouble remembering what everyone in your family needs at the store? Have you ever forgotten to bring your shopping list with you? OneList can help by:

-	Saving your lists so that they can be accessed from anywhere
-	Sharing your lists with friends/family so anyone can add/remove items.
-	Create additional shopping lists and have them all in one place.

Never forget your shopping lists again, ensure nobody is forgotten when buying for your household, or make sure your business is always stocked up with OneList.
